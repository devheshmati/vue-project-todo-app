# 🚀 Pro-Todo: Full-Stack Task Manager (Vue.js, Laravel API & GSAP)

---

### 📝 Project Overview

This Pro-Todo application masterfully balances robust security and exceptional, yet inherently simple, user experience (UX), driven by advanced GSAP animation techniques.

#### Backend & Security

The backend is built upon **Laravel**, providing a powerful **RESTful API**. Security is prioritized using **Laravel Sanctum** for **token-based authentication**, ensuring that all task management operations (CRUD) are secure and tied strictly to the authenticated user.

#### Frontend & Dynamic UX

The frontend leverages **Vue.js 3** with ٰComposition API to deliver a fast and reactive Single Page Application (SPA).

* **Tailwind CSS:** Used for a modern, utility-first design approach, resulting in a clean and highly responsive user interface.
* **GSAP Magic:** To elevate the UX beyond typical To-Do applications, **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** is utilized:
    * **SplitText & Transitions:** Enables smooth, micro-animations for task entry, status changes, and title displays, making the application feel fluid and professional.
    * **ScrollTrigger:** (If used) Used to create dynamic, scroll-linked visual effects, further enhancing user engagement.
